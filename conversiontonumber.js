// Conversion to a number is not as obvious as conversion to a string. It works as expected for strings that represent actual numbers, like "14", "-72.134", or strings that represent numbers in scientific notation, like "2e3", or special number values like "NaN" or "Infinity".
// However, the string can also contain numbers in hexadecimal, octal, and binary format. They must be preceded by 0x, 0o, or 0b respectively. For any string that cannot be converted to a special value, NaN (not a number) is returned. A BigInt can also be converted to a Number, but we need to remember that a BigInt can store much bigger values than a Number, so for large values, part of them can be truncated or end up being imprecise. The Boolean true is converted to 1, and false to 0 – this is common for many programming languages. An attempt to convert an undefined value will result in NaN, while null will be converted to 0.

console.log(Number(42));  //  ->  42
   
console.log(Number("11"));  //  ->  11
console.log(Number("0x11"));  //  ->  17
console.log(Number("0o11"));  //  ->  9
console.log(Number("0b11"));  //  ->  3
console.log(Number("12e3"));  //    ->  12000
console.log(Number("Infinity"));//  ->  Infinity
console.log(Number("text"));  //  ->  NaN
   
console.log(Number(14n));  //  ->  14
console.log(Number(123456789123456789123n));  //  -  >    123456789123
